# dev-null-clue-less

The project is divided in two distinct portions.  The Server & Client.

The Server is Node.js + Express.

Server Build Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gbugaisky/dev-null-clue-less.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gbugaisky/dev-null-clue-less)

To start developing the server, cd to the server directory, and run "npm install".

To run the server in dev mode, run "npm start".  This will also compile the TypeScript & set a watch on the files.
